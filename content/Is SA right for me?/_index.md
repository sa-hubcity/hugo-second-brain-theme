The SA Pamphlet, [To the Newcomer](https://www.sa.org/w/wp-content/uploads/newcomer.pdf), offers some questions to think about for those who wonder about seeking help for their problems with lust, pornography, and sex.

* Have you thought of getting help for your sexual thinking or behavior, or have others suggested that you do so?

* Have you tried to control or decrease sexual thoughts or behaviors and failed to do so?

* Do your sexual thoughts or behaviors interfere with your relations with your spouse or your responsibilities to others?

* Despite negative consequences of your sexual behaviors -- humiliations, dieseases, lies, jobs lost, arrests, divorces, or immoral acts -- have you continued those behaviors?

If these questions ring true, and you're willing to seek help, SA may be right for you.

If you're interested, [the SA website](https://www.sa.org/test/) has a longer "test" with more questions to think about. You do not have to say "yes" to every question, but if you are addicted you'll likely see many of your difficulties and consequences highlighted within them.
