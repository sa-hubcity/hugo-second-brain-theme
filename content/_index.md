**Welcome to the website of the local group of Sexaholics Anonymous in Hattiesburg, Mississippi.**
  
  <br>

## Who we are
"[Sexaholics Anonymous](https://www.sa.org) is a fellowship of men and women who share their experience, strength, and hope with each other that they may solve their common problem and help others to recover. The only requirement for membership is a desire to stop lusting and become sexually sober. There are no dues or fees for SA membership; we are self-supporting through our own contributions. SA is not allied with any sect, denomination, politics, organization, or institution; does not wish to engage in any controversy; neither endorses nor opposes any causes. Our primary purpose is to stay sexually sober and help others to achieve sexual sobriety."*

In other words, we are a group of people who are discovering and sharing a solution to our harmful addictions to lust, sex and pornography. With this solution, we no longer have to act out on our addictions and can experience freedom and recovery.

## What we do
As a group, we meet weekly on Monday mornings at 7:00am. We are a new group, but as we grow, we will likely expand the number of meetings and the diversity of meeting times and locations. During our meeting we read relevant [SA literature](https://www.sa.org/literature/) and [Alcoholics Anonymous literature](https://www.aa.org/the-big-book), share about how we are working to recover from our addictions, and build supportive relationships with each other.

## Sexaholics Anonymous: Statement of Principle
We have a solution. We don't claim it's for everybody, but for us, it works. If you identify with us and think you may share our problem, we'd like to share our solution with you (Sexaholics Anonymous, 2).

In defining sobriety, we do not speak for those outside Sexaholics Anonymous. We can only speak for ourselves. Thus, for the married sexaholic, sexual sobriety means having no form of sex with self or with persons other than the spouse. In SA's sobriety definition, the term "spouse" refers to oneâ€™s partner in a marriage between a man and a woman. For the unmarried sexaholic, sexual sobriety means freedom from sex of any kind. And for all of us, single and married alike, sexual sobriety also includes progressive victory over lust (Sexaholics Anonymous 191-192).

The only requirement for SA membership is a desire to stop lusting and become sexually sober according to the SA sobriety definition. Any two or more sexaholics gathered together for SA sobriety according to the SA sobriety
definition may call themselves an SA group.

Meetings that do not adhere to and follow Sexaholics Anonymous' sobriety statement as set forth in the foregoing Statement of Principle adopted by the General Delegate Assembly in 2010 are not SA meetings and shall not call themselves SA meetings.
