### Website
https://www.sa.org (Official SA Website)  

### Literature
SA literature can be found in [the SA online store](https://www.sexaholics.org/store/index.php?cPath=28). The core SA books are [Sexaholics Anonymous](https://www.sexaholics.org/store/product_info.php?cPath=25&products_id=32), more commonly known as "The White Book" and [Step into Action](https://www.sexaholics.org/store/product_info.php?cPath=25&products_id=78). The White Book can also be purchased in-person at the meeting, at the [Pine Grove bookstore](https://www.pinegrovetreatment.com/addiction-literature-book-store/), or as an E-book via [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08BWSLCDC).

A bunch of great pamphlets can be [downloaded for free](https://www.sa.org/literature/pamphlets/). Some that we think deserve particular mention are ["To the Newcomer"](https://www.sa.org/w/wp-content/uploads/newcomer.pdf) and ["Why Working the Steps is Important"](https://www.sa.org/w/wp-content/uploads/WhyWorkingTheStepsPamphlet.pdf).

The [ESSAY magazine](https://www.sa.org/essay/) is also free and provides stories and experiences from members of SA who have found a solution. 

The historical and practical foundation of the SA program is found in [Alcoholics Anonymous](https://www.aa.org/the-big-book), or the Big Book, and the [Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions](https://www.aa.org/twelve-steps-twelve-traditions), both of which are freely available online in text or audio format. 

[Here](https://www.sa.org/w/wp-content/uploads/approvedlit.pdf) is a list of all SA-approved literature.

### Groups
Besides our group, there are some other groups in the [State of Mississippi](https://www.sa.org/f2f/United-States-of-America/Mississippi/).
